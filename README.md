ResNet50_v2: the version 2 of the ResNet50 (Residual Network) model, a widely used deep learning model architecture, typically applied for image classification tasks. It contains 50 layers and is well-suited for processing image data. Version 2 typically includes improvements in training methodology over the original.

weights: the file contains the pre-trained weights of the ResNet50_v2 model. Weights are the parameters learned by the neural network during training and are used to make predictions during inference.

DIC: Differential Interference Contrast microscopy, a technique used in biological imaging that enhances the contrast in unstained, transparent samples, like live cells. The model have been trained on images obtained through this technique.

AIF: Axial Image Focus or All-in-Focus. In microscopy, AIF techniques enhance image sharpness by focusing on all depths in the sample, potentially improving classification performance.

DTCWT: Likely stands for Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform, an advanced image processing technique that captures multi-scale, multi-directional features, enhancing image analysis. It is sometimes used in combination with machine learning models for improved texture analysis and classification tasks.
